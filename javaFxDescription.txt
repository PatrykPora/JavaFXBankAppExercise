JAVA FX
based on youtube project https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkov5shwRQs&t=10623s


in resources, we need to add .fxml files that describes access to our controllers

it is a good practise when names of packages and structure is mirrored the controllers structure

in resorces we also put our images and styles


module-info.java is used to defines the module structure and dependencies for java module
- requires specifies the modules that module depends on
- opens allows other modules to access the specified package for reflection at runtime
- exports makes the specified packages accessible to other modules


we can open our fxml files in intelij scene builder or use external scene builder to work with our front part of app
recommended gluon scene builder

in .fxml files are ale labels text fields and so on -> those all elements should have been included in our controller class
just move cursor on element in .fxml file and then chose add field to controller class
REMEMBER to add our controller class in .fxml file
for example --->>> fx:controller="pl.pepe.bankapp.controllers.client.DashBoardController
all of us controllers like buttons labels etc. have to have name in scene builder -> then we will be able to add this controllers
to our controller class by .fxml file --> on fxml in intellij we clik on the name of controller and choose to add field to our controller class
it is a good idea to name controllers to know what they are. example we have label with amount then the name of controller could be -> amount_lable etc


CREATING CSS FILES IN NOT REALLY NECESSARY -> WE CAN USE SCENE BUILDER(IVEN THIS OF INTELIJ) TO CREATE THE WHOLE UI
