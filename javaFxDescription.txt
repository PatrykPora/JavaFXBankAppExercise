JAVA FX

in resources, we need to add .fxml files that describes access to our controllers

it is a good practise when names of packages and structure is mirrored the controllers structure

in resorces we also put our images and styles


module-info.java is used to defines the module structure and dependencies for java module
- requires specifies the modules that module depends on
- opens allows other modules to access the specified package for reflection at runtime
- exports makes the specified packages accessible to other modules


we can open our fxml files in intelij scene builder or use external scene builder to work with our front part of app
recommended gluon scene builder

in .fxml files are ale labels text fields and so on -> those all elements should have been included in our controller class
just move cursor on element in .fxml file and then chose add field to controller class

CREATING CSS FILES IN NOT REALLY NECESSARY -> WE CAN USE SCENE BUILDER(IVEN THIS OF INTELIJ) TO CREATE THE WHOLE UI
